This is a project written for Holiday Hacks Hackathon.

The purpose of this project is to allow users to create groups with friends or family to share wishlists for the holidays. 

You may create a group or add yourself into a group with a code. The people in the group will be able to add their own wishlists so that everyone in the group can see.

People can then select the items in your wish list to give to you. Everyone except for that person that created the wish list will be able to see what other people got, so it is easy to ensure there are no repeats in gifts. You can also get ideas and keep track of what you are getting them through this system.
